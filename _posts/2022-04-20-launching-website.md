# Official kickoff of the project!

We are delighted to announce the official kickoff of the four-year MALADES project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR). This project brings together four major French research partners in NLP and healthcare: Nantes University (LS2N), Avignon University (LIA), Aix-Marseille University (LIS), and Nantes Hospital (Data warehouse). The MALADES project aims to advance scientific research on Large Language Models (LLMs) for the medical and clinical fields in French.

More information to come, stay tuned :)
